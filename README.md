## Instructions

Your Kin recruiting contact should have sent you a set of instructions for this test.

## How to use this boilerplate

We are a Typescript-first shop and value your understanding of TS/JS over Angular. If you have never used Angular before, you can find the framework documentation here: https://angular.dev/overview.

All of our applications are using the modern versions of Angular, so feel free to use [standalone components](https://angular.dev/essentials/components) and the [new control flow syntax](https://blog.angular.io/meet-angulars-new-control-flow-a02c6eee7843) to make it feel more like React, Vue or Svelt if that's what you are used to.

Feel free to remove routing or upgrade any of the dependencies if you need to.

Please use the `./sample.csv` file as input into your application.
